  // A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission.
  // However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons!
  // each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry..
  // Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another
  // specific given number of dragons, will he survive?
  //   Return true if yes, false otherwise :)

  // function hero(bullets, dragons) {
  //   return dragons * 2 <= bullets ? true : false
  // }



  // For example(Input --> Output):
  // 10 --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
  // 1 --> [1]
